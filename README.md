# liro

Liro is a Discord bot that follows in the footsteps of
[Lichess-discord-bot](https://github.com/tvdhout/Lichess-discord-bot/), without
necessarily aiming to replace it. The main pain point that this bot is trying
to solve is automating the role assignment for denizens of the IM Rosen Discord
server.

This project also aims to increase rating support to not only lichess accounts,
but also chesscom.
